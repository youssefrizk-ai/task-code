compiler vs interpreter:
#from speed:
The compiler is faster because it translates the entire code at once, while the interpreter interprets each line and takes more time.
#from Error:
Compiler: Detects and reports all errors during the compilation phase before running the program.
Interpreter: Stops execution when it encounters the first error during interpretation.
#from Method:
Compiler: Translates the entire source code into machine code at once before execution (produces an executable file).
Interpreter: Reads and executes the code line by line during runtime.
